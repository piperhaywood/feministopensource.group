            <p>As open source investigators, we tell stories. Stories in between the ones on the news, from beneath the rubble, and in the screens of the cyberworld. We wanted to know how to amplify the stories that we are not hearing; the ones that get lost behind data points, in the blind spots of youtube videos, in the corners of facebook. So, we began to ask: what does a feminist open source investi&shy;gation look&nbsp;like?</p>

            <p>From the intersection of tech and human rights, our collective is following this line of inquiry to forge a feminist methodo&shy;logy for open source investi&shy;gation. We are building an ethical feminist conscious&shy;ness rooted in the tenets of care, intersec&shy;tionality and equity. How can we visualize data differently? How can we widen path&shy;ways of account&shy;ability? How can we better remember the narratives of open source&nbsp;data?</p>

            <p>Join us on this journey as we build a new way to&nbsp;remember.</p>

            <p>In peace and power,<br>
            The FemOS Group</p>
